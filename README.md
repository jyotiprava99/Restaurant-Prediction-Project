## Restaurant Prediction Project:
A machine Learning Project aimed at predicting the aggregate rating of restaurants based on various features.
## Steps include:
1-Data Processing : Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables and split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure accurate model training and evaluation.

2-Model Development : Employed regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree regression and random forest regression to train predictive models on the training data.

3-Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of the models using regression metrics like mean squared error and R-squared on the testing data, ensuring the model's effectivness and reliability.

4-Result Interpretation: Analyzed the model's results to understand the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings, providing valuable insights for stakeholders.Overall, by understanding the influence of features such as online delivery, price range, and country code etc.. on aggregate ratings, stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance the dining experience, attract more customers, and improve overall business performance. These insights enable stakeholders to adapt their strategies to meet evolving consumer preferences and market dynamics, ultimately driving greater success in the restaurant industry.

Based on the evaluation results of the three models:

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1.22
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.92
   - R-squared: 0.46
   
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.06
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.15
   - R-squared: 0.98

3. **Random Forest Regressor**:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.03
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.11
   - R-squared: 0.99

We can draw the following conclusions for the project:

1. **Model Performance**:
   - The Random Forest Regressor outperforms both the Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor models in terms of predictive accuracy.
   - The Random Forest model achieves the lowest values for MSE, MAE, and the highest R-squared, indicating superior performance in capturing the variability of the target variable and making accurate predictions.

2. **Model Complexity**:
   - While the Decision Tree Regressor achieves high accuracy, it may suffer from overfitting due to its tendency to capture noise in the training data. 
   - The Random Forest Regressor, being an ensemble of decision trees, tends to mitigate overfitting by averaging the predictions of multiple trees.

3. **Practical Considerations**:
   - Despite the Linear Regression model having the lowest complexity, its performance is significantly lower compared to the tree-based models.
   - The Random Forest Regressor provides the best balance between accuracy and generalizability, making it the most suitable choice for deployment in real-world applications.

4. **Recommendation**:
   - Based on the evaluation results, the Random Forest Regressor is recommended for predicting the aggregate ratings of restaurants in the project.
   - Further optimization and fine-tuning of the Random Forest model could potentially lead to even better performance, but it already demonstrates excellent predictive capability with the provided features.

In summary, the project's best model for predicting restaurant aggregate ratings is the Random Forest Regressor, offering high accuracy and robustness for practical deployment.
