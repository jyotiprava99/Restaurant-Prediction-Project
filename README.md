## Restaurant Prediction Project:
A machine Learning Project aimed at predicting the aggregate rating of restaurants based on various features.
## Steps include:
1-Data Processing : Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables and split the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure accurate model training and evaluation.

2-Model Development : Employed regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree regression and random forest regression to train predictive models on the training data.

3-Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of the models using regression metrics like mean squared error and R-squared on the testing data, ensuring the model's effectivness and reliability.

4-Result Interpretation: Analyzed the model's results to understand the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings, providing valuable insights for stakeholders.
